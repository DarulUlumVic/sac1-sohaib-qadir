Task1

You've recently joined a company specializing in Islamic home finance, 
where conventional interest-based mortgages are avoided. Instead, 
the company operates on the principle of Ijarah, a form of leasing 
where the bank owns the property and leases it to the homeowner. 
You're tasked with developing a program to calculate the rental rate for 
a home using this Islamic finance concept.

Pseudo code:

FUNCTION calculateIjarahRentalRate(totalAmount, rentalPeriod)
BEGIN
    rentalRate = (totalAmount * rentalPeriod) / 100
    RETURN rentalRate
END FUNCTION


1. Implement a function based on the provided Ijarah rental rate formula.
2. Write code to utilize this function, passing in values from the test data, and display the calculated rental rate.
3. Construct a test table using a word processing tool, filling it with the provided test data and expected results.
